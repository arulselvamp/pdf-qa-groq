question,gold_answer
List any limitations mentioned.,"Existing research has not taken into account the insiders’ time-sequence-centric dynamic behavior, which limits effective detection with only static pattern-based methods"
What dataset did the authors use for evaluation?,The Insider Threat Test Dataset developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University
What is the main conclusion of the document?,"The proposed Hybrid GRU-CNN classification strategy achieved 98.43% accuracy in training (false positive rate 0.17%) and 97.12% accuracy in testing (false positive rate 2.88%), outperforming state-of-the-art methods for insider attack detection"
What methods were used in the study?,A hybrid GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) + CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) machine learning model for insider attack classification
Who are the authors of the paper?,"Arul Selvam P (Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE, Hindusthan College of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore)"
